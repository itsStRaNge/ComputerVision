%FUNDMATRIX_LS computes the fundamental matrix using the linear method.
%
%   F = fundmatrix_ls(xy1xy2, idx, ws)
%   F = fundmatrix_ls(xy1xy2, idx, ws, scale)
%   [F,errs] = fundmatrix_ls(xy1xy2, idx, ws)
%   [F,errs] = fundmatrix_ls(xy1xy2, idx, ws, scale)
%   [F,errs,avgerr] = fundmatrix_ls(xy1xy2, idx, ws)
%   [F,errs,avgerr] = fundmatrix_ls(xy1xy2, idx, ws, scale)
%
%   estimates the fundamental matrix using the linear method and assuming that
%   all corresponding points are inliers.  The corresponding point coordinates
%   should be stored in the large 6-by-n matrix of the following format:
%      xy1xy2 = [x1_1  x1_2 ... x1_n;
%                y1_1  y1_2 ... y1_n;
%                z1_1  z1_2 ... z1_n;
%                x2_1  x2_2 ... x2_n;
%                y2_1  y2_2 ... y2_n;
%                z2_1  z2_2 ... z2_n ]
%   where [x1_i, y1_i, z1_i] is the i-th feature point (in homogeneous coordinates)
%         in the first image;
%         [x2_i, y2_i, z2_i] is the i-th feature point (in homogeneous coordinates)
%         in the second image;
%         each column of the matrix stores a pair of corresponding points in
%         homogeneous coordinates.
%
%   The fundmental matrix, F, is a rank-2 3-by-3 matrix satisfying the epipolar
%   constraint:
%                            (x1_i)
%     (x2_i y2_i z2_i) * F * (y1_i) = 0
%                            (z1_i)
%
%   Input arguments:
%   - xy1xy2 should be a 6-by-n matrix where n >= 8.  It is recommended that
%     the coordinates of points in this matrix be relative to an image coordinate
%     system whose origin is at the centre (or principal point, if known) of
%     the image.
%   - idx must be an array of integers in the range [1,n] where n=size(xy1xy2,2).
%     Alternatively, set idx to [] if all the points in xy1xy2 are intended
%     to be used for the estimation of F.
%   - ws should be an array of weighting factors, one for each pair of corresponding
%     points.  If a normal linear method is desired (ie. no weighting factors to
%     be applied) then ws can be set to [].
%   - scale (optional) is the scale factor to be used in least squares to keep
%     things well behaved.  If not specified, a scale factor would be automatically
%     computed (Referencee: see Hartley's ICCV'95 paper).  If specified, a sensible
%     scale factor is half of the average of the image dimensions, eg. if the images
%     are of dimensions 400-by-600 then scale should be set to 500/2 = 250.
%
%   Output arguments:
%   - F is the rank-2 3-by-3 fundamental matrix.
%   - errs is the list of reprojection errors (orthogonal distance errors of
%     the feature points from the epipolar lines) of all the feature point in xy1xy2.
%   - avgerr is the average squared reprojection error, i.e. the mean value of errs.
%
%   Examples:
%   (a)   [F,errs,avgerr] = fundmatrix_ls(xy1xy2, [], []);
%   (b)   [F,errs,avgerr] = fundmatrix_ls(xy1xy2, ones(size(xy1xy2,2), 1), []);
%   (c)   [F,errs,avgerr] = fundmatrix_ls(xy1xy2, [], 1:10);
%   In examples (a) and (b), all the corresponding points in xy1xy2 would be used
%   to estimate F and they all have the weighting factors of 1.  Both examples would
%   produce the same result.
%   In example (c), no weighting factors are specified and only the first 10 pairs of
%   corresponding points would be used for estimating F.  The third argument,
%   idx, thus allows the function to be used in the RANSAC/LMedS framework.
