Feature Based Dense Disparity Estimation

1. Copy all the files in one folder.
2. Run the FDDE.m file.
3. For running the code on another image, change the image from Line 5 and 6 of the FDDE.m file. 
4. Feed the Bin_nos in Line 41 manually. It has been presently set to 17 and can be varied depending on image entropy/ color variation. 
The code has been developed lately by lab associates and there may be certain bugs. The user is most welcome to report them on the exchange, and send corrections for others to take help out of it.
